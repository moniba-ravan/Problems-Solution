# 🧠 Problem-Solving Practice
 Sep 2017 - Dec2021

This repository contains a selection of problems I've solved over the years during my competitive programming journey. It's not a full archive, but I occasionally added some of the solutions I practiced — especially from contests and well-known platforms like ICPC, UVa, Codeforces, and Hacker Cup.

## 📌 Background

During my bachelor's studies, I was actively involved in competitive programming for around four years. I participated in contests, practiced regularly, and improved my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking by solving hundreds of problems.

## 🏆 Highlights

- Participated in **ACM/ICPC** contests

- Reached the **Top 2000 finalists** in the **Meta Hacker Cup 2020**, and received an official t-shirt 🎽

- Regular practice on Codeforces

## 📁 What's in this repository?

You'll find solutions to selected problems, written in various languages (mostly C++ and Python), grouped by platform or topic. These include:

- Classic problems from UVa Online Judge
- Training problems and contests from Codeforces
- A few Hacker Cup practice problems

The goal of this repo is to keep a small, curated reference of my problem-solving path.
